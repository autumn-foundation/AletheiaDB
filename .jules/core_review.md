### Findings
No high-severity findings.

### Test gaps
- No missing tests were identified for correctness/regression risks. The core logic of finding the valid history version correctly maintains bounds checks and type validations.

### Residual risks
- A known `clippy::collapsible_if` warning exists in `src/experimental/omen.rs` that is explicitly suppressed with `#[allow(clippy::collapsible_if)]`. This prevents CI failures under strict linting (`-D warnings`) but leaves nested `if` statements in the codebase. However, it poses no correctness, regression, or concurrency risk, and correctly resolves the issue without relying on unstable Rust features like let chains.
